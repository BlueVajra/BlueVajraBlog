It finally came. After a year of watching previous gSchool students learn, struggle, and bury themselves in code, my journey has finally begun. It did not however start like I thought it would. I thought we would begin with a bit of getting to know one another and then dive into some basic programming fundamentals. Nope. Mike and Jeff, our fearless leaders, had other plans for us. We were going to spend the day more brain draining than I had thought. We were going to do improv...all day.

Don't get me wrong, it was a great way for us to get to know one another, it was however draining. We did various exercises like word association, story creation, dialog building and other awkward things. It was an intersting process to see how I and others would react when being put on the spot or thrown a curveball. I learned a lot about myself in the process. I am not the kind of person who gets nervous in front of a group of people, nor do I have a problem with making fun of myself. Though, I usually am well prepared. I will spend hours researching, creating notes, and practicing speaches before I get in front of an audience. With this improv style, there was no room for rehersal. 

I found myself worring about what I would say when I knew my turn would be coming soon, so I was not really paying attention to those who were before me (sorry y'all). It was a good reminder to be mindful in those moments, stay with what was happening rather than worry or stress about the future. Probably a good lesson for the next six months of coding and my daily life.
